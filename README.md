# The-Star-Recipe-App

This application allow you to search many differents recipes, to make pizza, pasta, bread, avocado and many others types of food.

I have implemented it with many features, like rendering the view of the recipe, custom servings and automatically update the quantity of the ingredients based on them, bookmark and the recipes, creates own recipes and automatically bookmark them. This project is constantly under construction, so other features will be added.
